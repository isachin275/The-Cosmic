                    <p>Arbitration
                    </p>
                    <p>In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or
                        concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or
                        otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be
                        resolved
                        only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a
                        single
                        neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar
                        arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties.
                        The
                        arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having
                        jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises
                        out
                        of or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its
                        costs and reasonable attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims
                        regarding these Terms and Conditions or any disputes arising as a result of these Terms and
                        Conditions, whether directly or indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these
                        Terms
                        and Conditions. The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation
                        and
                        enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of
                        this
                        arbitration provision shall be determined by the arbitrator. This arbitration provision shall
                        survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions.

                    <p>Class Action Waiver
                    </p>
                    <p>Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an individual basis; class
                        arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE
                        THAT A
                        PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
                        PLAINTIFF
                        OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN
                        THE
                        FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and Cosmic
                        Friend agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and
                        may
                        not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

                    <p>Termination/Access Restriction
                    </p>
                    <p>Cosmic Friend reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Site
                        and
                        the related services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent
                        permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Texas and you hereby
                        consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Texas in all disputes arising out
                        of or
                        relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does
                        not
                        give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this section.
                        You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between
                        you
                        and Cosmic Friend as a result of this agreement or use of the Site. Cosmic Friend's performance
                        of
                        this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this
                        agreement is in derogation of Cosmic Friend's right to comply with governmental, court and law
                        enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or information provided to
                        or
                        gathered by Cosmic Friend with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is determined
                        to
                        be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the
                        warranty
                        disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable
                        provision
                        will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent
                        of
                        the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.
                        Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
                        user
                        and Cosmic Friend with respect to the Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
                        communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and Cosmic
                        Friend with respect to the Site. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in
                        electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
                        relating
                        to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business
                        documents
                        and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to the
